What is it?
-------
Library of mixins for faster and easier writing styles in js.

Documentation
-------
You can see the [full documentation here](http://stylz.surge.sh/).

Usage
-------
The functions are written with ES6 so if you're using a project with ES6 and Babel you can pick and import just the functions that you need. If you're using ES5 you need to import [the compiled version](https://github.com/kitze/stylz/blob/master/dist/stylz.min.js) that's in the [dist folder](https://github.com/kitze/stylz/tree/master/dist).

Dependencies
-------
The mixins which use color depend on [color.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color)

Tests
-------
Every single one of the functions is tested with mocha and the coverage is reported with [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).
If the test coverage report is under 100% i cannot publish a new release, so you can be 100% sure that everything is working fine and it's safe to use.
